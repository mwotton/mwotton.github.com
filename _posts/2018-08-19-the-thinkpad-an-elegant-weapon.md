I like ThinkPads.

They've never been cool. Ownership marked you as one of two equally
unhip tribes - either a drone in a suit, bashing out spreadsheets and
TPS reports kilometres up while some entitled bastard makes hamburger
mince out of your knees, or a 400lb hacker well-actuallying usenet
threads and prefixing "GNU/" on every project in sight like a crazed
graffiti artist.  Nobody's ever headlined Lollapalooza on a ThinkPad.

And yet. If laptops were violins, the Thinkpad is what would happen if
Stradivarius decided to make his next project bulletproof for
funsies: Linux-friendly at a time when debugging X11 configs
and sound drivers was a mandatory rite of passage, rugged enough not
to be precious about, and sporting a tall screen for extra code
space. A ThinkPad was a reliable comrade in the war on complexity.

And the keyboards! It's as if they'd actually talked to users who
typed for a living - hardware buttons for sound control and
brightness, a proper function key row, and a bouncy, kinetic key
action that let you know the machine was listening.

The last usable keyboard on a laptop was on the T420, in 2011. Apple lured every
other manufacturer into a doomed arms race of making laptops thinner
and lighter, far past any possible utility. I fully expect to see a
monomolecular laptop running MacOS X in the near future, and its
keyboard will fail every time Schr√∂dinger's cat meows.

I don't mean to discount other brands. My tankish HP, my cute little
ASUS netbook, and even my MacBook Pro were instruments of
creation. They had keyboards with satisfying, chunky actions, and they
invited you to do something cool, not just passively imbibe the work
of others.

But somehow, despite the proliferation of tablets, phablets, and
voice-activated TVs, the market has decided that the one portable
device which was useful for producing things is now primarily for
Netflix and Youtube. Who cares if the keyboard causes you to mistype a
few words in the comments section? Nobody's going to be able to
distinguish it from the background roar of illiteracy.

The ThinkPad fought the good fight for a long time, longer than almost
every other, but even Lenovo folded in the end. The 25th anniversary
edition is almost mockery, planting a reasonable keyboard on an
otherwise painfully mediocre machine.

I haven't given up, though. While I write this on a sticker-covered
T410 and my travel T420s sits at home charging, my mailbox awaits a
T70. I paid $1500 5 months ago for this machine: an unofficial,
homebrew chimera, modern innards transplanted into a T60 chassis by
the incommunicative wizards of LCDFans, a fever dream of a laptop that
might never arrive: this is how deep the yearning goes.
