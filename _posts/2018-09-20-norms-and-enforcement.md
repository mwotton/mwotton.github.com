dynamics of social group formation
- starts with very casual norms and strong relationship bonds
  - example: friendship group with in-jokes & full connectivity
  - informal, relationship-based enforcement of norms
- as it grows, norms become more important and relationship networks less so
  - examples
	- programming language community
	- sports team
	- twitter subcultures
- however, because norms are initially enforced by social sanctions, and these
  sanctions become less powerful as the personal relationships weaken, eventually
  social groups go one of two ways
  - explicit, codified norms with formal punishments for breaking them
	- states
	- large technical groups with CoC
  - expansion past some point breaks cohesion
    - eternal september
	- [evaporative cooling](http://blog.bumblebeelabs.com/?p=1207)
	- examples
	  - internet
	  - ruby community
